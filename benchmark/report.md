# Edge Server Performance Benchmark Report

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Target:** http://localhost:3400
**Environment:** development
**Test Tool:** Artillery 2.0.27

## Executive Summary

The Gatrix Edge server demonstrated excellent performance under the tested load, with sub-millisecond average response times for most cached endpoints. The server successfully handled a peak load of approximately 280 requests per second with negligible latency.

## Test Configuration

- **Warm up:** 60s (5 -> 50 arrivals/sec)
- **Sustained load:** 120s (50 arrivals/sec)
- **Stress:** 60s (50 -> 100 arrivals/sec)
- **Total Requests:** 60,750
- **Total VUsers:** 12,150

## Key Metrics (Aggregate)

| Metric                     | Value           |
| :------------------------- | :-------------- |
| **Total Success (200 OK)** | 48,600 (80%)    |
| **Total Failures (404)**   | 12,150 (20%) \* |
| **Avg Response Time**      | 0.5 ms          |
| **p50 Latency**            | 0 ms            |
| **p95 Latency**            | 1 ms            |
| **p99 Latency**            | 2 ms            |
| **Request Rate**           | 281 req/sec     |
| **Throughput**             | ~1.0 MB/sec     |

_\* Note: 404 responses were specifically from the `ingame-popup-notices` endpoint, indicating that no data was available in the development environment for that specific resource during the test. All other endpoints returned 200 OK._

## Endpoint Performance

| Endpoint                | Count  | Avg Latency | p99 Latency |
| :---------------------- | :----- | :---------- | :---------- |
| `/client-version`       | 12,150 | 0.6 ms      | 2 ms        |
| `/game-worlds`          | 12,150 | 0.4 ms      | 1 ms        |
| `/banners`              | 12,150 | 0.4 ms      | 1 ms        |
| `/service-notices`      | 12,150 | 0.5 ms      | 2 ms        |
| `/ingame-popup-notices` | 12,150 | 0.6 ms      | 2 ms        |

## Insights & Recommendations

1.  **Cache Efficiency:** The extremely low latency (median 0ms, avg 0.5ms) confirms that the Gatrix Edge SDK cache is working effectively, serving requests directly from memory without any significant processing overhead.
2.  **Scalability:** The server handled the ramp-up and stress phases (up to 100 arrivals/sec, resulting in ~300 req/sec) without any degradation in response time.
3.  **Data Consistency:** The 404s for `ingame-popup-notices` should be verified. If this is expected in the development environment, no action is needed. Otherwise, check if the data is properly synchronized to the Edge.
4.  **Hardware Overhead:** Given the low response times, the Edge server is currently limited more by networking/OS overhead than by application logic.
