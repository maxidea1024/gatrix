## Help Command Integration

All SD commands are now included in the `help` command under a new category:

```bash
help
```

**Output includes:**
```
Service Discovery:
  sd                   Service Discovery management
  sd-list              List all registered services
  sd-register          Register a new service
  sd-deregister        Deregister a service
  sd-health            Check service health status
  sd-discover          Discover services by name or tag
  sd-watch             Watch for service changes
  sd-stats             Show service discovery statistics
```

---

## Command-Specific Help

Each command supports `--help`:

```bash
sd-list --help
sd-register --help
sd-health --help
# etc.
```

---

## Implementation Status

**Current Status:** Placeholder implementations

All commands currently return:
- Informative messages about what the command will do
- Parameter validation and examples
- Clear indication that the feature is not yet implemented

**Message Format:**
```
Service Discovery feature is not yet implemented.
```

## Future Implementation Checklist

When implementing the actual Service Discovery feature:

### 1. Service Registry
- [ ] Create service registry data structure
- [ ] Implement service registration logic
- [ ] Implement service deregistration logic
- [ ] Add service metadata storage

### 2. Health Checking
- [ ] Implement health check mechanism
- [ ] Add configurable health check intervals
- [ ] Support multiple health check types (HTTP, TCP, gRPC)
- [ ] Track health check history

### 3. Service Discovery
- [ ] Implement service lookup by name
- [ ] Implement service lookup by tag
- [ ] Add load balancing strategies
- [ ] Support service versioning

### 4. Monitoring & Events
- [ ] Implement real-time service watching
- [ ] Add event notifications (SSE/WebSocket)
- [ ] Track service statistics
- [ ] Add metrics collection

### 5. Integration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Service Registration Flow

```bash
# 1. Register a service
sd-register --name "api-server" --host "localhost" --port "3000" --tags "api,backend"

# 2. List all services
sd-list

# 3. Check health
sd-health --name "api-server"

# 4. Discover services by tag
sd-discover --tag "backend"

# 5. Watch for changes
sd-watch --name "api-server"

# 6. View statistics
sd-stats

# 7. Deregister when done
sd-deregister --id "service-123"
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Register with metadata
sd-register --name "api-v2" --host "api.example.com" --port "443" \
  --tags "api,v2,production" \
  --meta '{"version":"2.0.0","region":"us-east-1"}'

# Filter services
sd-list --filter "api"
sd-list --status healthy

# Discover by multiple criteria
sd-discover --tag "production"
sd-discover --name "api-v2"
```
